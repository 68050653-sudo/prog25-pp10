Using AI to help programmers can take different forms. Two common approaches are using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, and using coding agents such as GitHub Copilot. Although both rely on AI, they support programmers in different ways.

When using an LLM like ChatGPT, programmers describe the specification of the program, and the model generates complete code in response. For example, a user may ask ChatGPT to “write a Python function that checks whether a number is prime.” The model will output the entire function directly. This method is useful when programmers want a quick prototype or a full solution from natural language. Its advantages include flexibility, explanation ability, and the ability to generate from plain text. However, it also has disadvantages: the generated code may contain hallucinations, logical mistakes, or not follow the intended coding style. Programmers must carefully review and test the results.

On the other hand, coding agents like GitHub Copilot work as assistants inside the coding environment. Instead of generating full programs, Copilot provides code completions while programmers type. For instance, when a programmer writes def is_prime(, Copilot may automatically suggest the rest of the function. This makes the workflow faster and more interactive. Its advantages are higher accuracy, less hallucination, and better integration with human thought. The drawback is that it depends on the programmer’s partial input; it cannot create a full project from a high-level description.

In conclusion, LLMs provide creative generation from ideas, while coding agents enhance precision during development. Both complement each other when used wisely.
